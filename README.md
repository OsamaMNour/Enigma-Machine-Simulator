Enigma Machine:
This code is an implementation of the Enigma machine, a famous electro-mechanical cipher machine used by the Germans during World War II to encrypt messages.

The Enigma machine used a set of rotors, a reflector, a plugboard, and other settings to perform the encryption process. The encryption method changed with each keypress because of the rotation of the rotors. The ciphertext was decrypted by reversing the encryption process.

This implementation of the Enigma machine allows the user to encrypt a message using the settings specified in the code. The settings can be changed by modifying the variables rotors, reflector, ringSettings, ringPositions, and plugboard.

Here are some links to help you understand the Enigma machine and how it works:
